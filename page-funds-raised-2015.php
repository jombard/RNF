            <h2>Distribution of funds raised in 2015</h2>

            <p>In 2015, we raised over £10,000* (before Gift Aid). This was largely thanks to our amazing <a href="/fundraising/">fundraisers</a> who took on challenges for us.</p>

            <p>If you’re interested in doing some fundraising for us, <a href="/contact-us">get in touch</a>. 

            <p>Funds were also raised through Laura and Jon’s incredible <a href="/challenges/2015-challenges/mile-a-day/">Mile a Day challenge</a>, a <a href="/charity-skydive-2015/">skydive</a> and participation in <a href="/challenges/2015-challenges/blenheim-triathlon-2015/">Blenheim triathlon</a>, as well as ongoing donations from our generous supporters.</p>

            <p>We shared these donations between our chosen organisations in the proportions set out below. Some of these organisations are ones that we supported with funds from 2014, some are new additions; there are so many organisations providing fantastic support to people living with dementia, and it is important to us to support a range of different organisations.</p>

            <p>Please get in touch if you have a suggestion of an organisation we could support.</p>

            <p>*Please note, for this round of funding we distributed a total of £10,000. We raised over this amount in 2015 and the surplus, together with the gift aid income, will be included in the next round of funding.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about how funds are being distributed please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>

                    <p>In 2013, Carers Trust published the research report <a href="https://carers.org/article/road-less-rocky-supporting-carers-people-dementia" target="_blank">A road less rocky</a>, which found that carers of people with dementia are not getting the support and advice they need.</p>

                    <p>In August 2016, Carers Trust launched a campaign to highlight older carer issues, including carers of people with dementia. It will build on the A road less rocky research, and our donation will help with key costs, such as transport and replacement care to help carers attend round table or parliamentary events – ensuring that their experiences and voices are heard and help to campaign for better services.</p>

                    <p>This will improve the standard of care received by the person being cared for, as well as the quality of life for both the carer and the cared for person. This will also ensure carers of people with dementia will receive more and better support at all stages of their caring role.</p>
