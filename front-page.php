			<h3><strong>What is Remembering Not to Forget?</strong></h3>
	        <p><a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> is a small charity established at the end of 2013 
	        	to fundraise to support people impacted by dementia.</p>
	        <p>Co-founders Laura and Ali both have close family members with dementia, and wanted to help
	        	other families affected by the condition.</p>
	        <p>In 2014 we undertook 10 challenges in 10 months to kickstart our fundraising, continuing 
	        	with other challenges in 2015.</p>
	        <p>We have raised over <strong>Â£22,000</strong> in our first two years.</p>
	        <p><a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> provides funds to organisations which:</p>

	        <ul class="rnfflower">
	            <li>Help people with dementia to live independently for as long as possible, and as the 
	            	disease progresses ensure they have a good quality of life and receive high standards 
	            	of care.</li>
	            <li>Provide support to families caring for someone with dementia.</li>
	            <li>Carry out research into treatments or a cure for dementia.</li>
	            <li>Campaign on dementia issues.</li>
	        </ul>

	        <p>We support organisations working both nationally and those with a focus on Somerset and the 
	        	South West, as both Laura and Ali are originally from Somerset. Read more about the 
	        	<a href="/funds">organisations we are supporting</a>.</p>

	        <p class="lead">Making a donation is quick and easy, please support our cause by donating 
	        	whatever you can.</p>
