                <h3>Information about Remembering Not To Forget</h3>
                <p><a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> is a small charity established at the end of 2013 to 
                    fundraise to support people impacted by dementia. Co-founders Laura and Ali both have close 
                    family members with dementia, and have experienced first-hand the pain of seeing someone 
                    affected by the condition.</p>
                <p>We’ve set up our own charity because we want to be able to direct funds to a mixture of small, 
                    local organisations in Somerset and the South West, and to national organisations. In 2014 we 
                    undertook 10 challenges in 10 months to kickstart our fundraising, with further events and 
                    challenges undertaken in 2015.</p>

	                            <p class="lead">Co-founder and Chairman</p>
	                            <p>Laura (née Corrick) is a primary school teacher currently working in 
                                    Christchurch in Dorset who likes to set herself a challenge! After 
                                    participating in a marathon, a triathlon, a 500 mile bike ride and 
                                    climbing the 3 peaks all for fun she felt that perhaps her energy could 
                                    be channelled into making a bit more of a difference.</p>
	                            <p>Unfortunately, since 2011 Laura has had to learn a lot more about dementia 
                                    and she decided to focus her energy on raising money and awareness towards 
                                    related charities.</p>
	                            <p>When Laura and Ali dreamt up <a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> she 
                                    was intent on working hard to raise awareness and funds for the disease. 
                                    Dementia affects so many more people than is realised and it's important 
                                    that everyone is better informed about what can be done to help researchers, 
                                    family members and carers tackle this horrible illness.</p>
	                            <p>So come on, help us do more!</p>

                            	<h3>Ali Turnbull</h3>
                            	<p class="lead">Co-founder and Secretary</p>
                                <p>Ali’s mum Bridget was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2006 at the age of 61. 
                                    Bridget worked as a nurse for forty years, balancing her demanding job with 
                                    bringing up two daughters and being involved in a range of charity and local 
                                    community voluntary work.</p>
                                <p>She took part in Cancer Research’s annual door to door collection for twenty 
                                    years, raising thousands of pounds through a combination of being very 
                                    persuasive and very persistent.</p>
                                <p>When Bridget got her diagnosis she joked that she’d been fundraising for the
                                    wrong charity for all those years!</p>
                                <p>Setting up <a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> was a way for Ali to do 
                                    some fundraising on behalf of, and in honour of, Bridget and the thousands 
                                    of people living with dementia in the UK. It was also an attempt to feel a 
                                    bit less powerless in the face of this heartbreaking condition.</p>
                                <p>Ali had been wanting to sign up to some physical challenges for a while, and 
                                    in late 2013 she mentioned the idea of doing some fundraising for dementia 
                                    related charities to Laura.</p>
                                <p>From there <a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> was born...</p>
                                <p>Ali grew up in Wiveliscombe, Somerset but has been living in London since 2003. 
                                    She worked for not-for-profit organisations supporting children and young 
                                    people in the UK and internationally for most of that time, but in 2014 started 
                                    to retrain as a primary school teacher.</p>
                                <p>Ali has been overwhelmed by the support from family and friends since 
                                    <a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> was set up, 
                                    and also pretty surprised that her various injured joints allowed her to 
                                    complete the physical challenges.</p>
                                <p>She is looking forward to getting started with challenges again in 2016.</p>

                            	<p class="lead">Trustee and Treasurer</p>
                                <p>Helen was secretly very grateful that the formation of 
                                    <a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> coincided with her year off travelling 
                                    but did enjoy being able to support the few challenges she was here for 
                                    (the fact that cold swimming topped support car driving says something about 
                                    how much Helen usually drives).</p>
                                <p>Helping people to live well with dementia, and helping others to understand 
                                    how they can facilitate that, is what drives Helen to be part of 
                                    <a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> and she's really proud of all the 
                                    team have done so far.</p>
                                <p>As a qualified accountant working in the charity sector Helen was the obvious 
                                    choice for treasurer, although Ali has done such a good job of keeping track 
                                    of the finances she hasn't had to do very much.</p>
                                <p>Helen has also contributed her husband Duncan, as participant and transport 
                                    provider, for several of the challenges, and although Helen is hoping to take 
                                    part in some proper challenges herself this year she's grateful to have Duncan 
                                    as a willing proxy!</p>

                            	<p class="lead">Trustee</p>
                                <p>Matt lives in Chard, Somerset with his partner Sharon and daughters Tilly and 
                                    Lottie. Matt is Laura's eldest brother and is often called in to keep her in 
                                    check!</p>
                                <p>His involvement with <a href="/">Remembering Not To Forget</a> began when Laura 
                                    and Ali first dreamt up the idea of doing something to increase awareness of 
                                    dementia and raise money for related charities, a subject which is close to 
                                    all of our hearts.</p>
                                <p>They decided they needed some responsible people to curb their enthusiasm and 
                                    reign in some of their overly creative thinking, so he was asked to be a 
                                    Trustee!</p>
                                <p>Along with being very pragmatic, Matt is very good at conducting thorough 
                                    research before making decisions and it was felt he'd be an asset to the 
                                    <a href="/">Remembering Not To Forget</a> team to ensure that we made the most 
                                    of the funds raised.</p>
                                <p><a href="/">Remembering Not To Forget</a>'s achievements during 2014 were 
                                    nothing short of amazing and something Matt is very proud of, and he looks 
                                    forward to being a part of another successful year in 2015.</p>

                            	<p class="lead">Trustee</p>
                            	<p>Kate’s involvement with <a href="/">Remembering Not to Forget</a> came about because 
                                    ultimately everyone should have a lawyer hanging around (even if no-one actually 
                                    wants one hanging around).</p>
                                <p>Having known Ali, Helen and Laura for many years and having a grandparent who was 
                                    diagnosed with dementia, Kate was delighted to be involved and hopefully to be able 
                                    to use over 15 years of legal skills to support, if even a small way, people 
                                    impacted by dementia.</p>
                                <p>However, with all the amazing hard work done by the other trustees there hasn’t been 
                                    too much for Kate to do and really she is worried that acting as trustee has done 
                                    more for her than it has for <a href="/">Remembering Not To Forget</a>…</p>
                                <p>Raising funds to support people living with dementia and their families/carers has 
                                    involved challenges that people have described variously as "crazy", "mad", "weird" 
                                    and "stupid". However, the cold swims, the London to Paris cycle and the Henley Classic 
                                    were all amazing experiences, and with the tremendous support of <a href="/">Remembering 
                                    Not To Forget</a>’s donors they have raised funds for a truly important cause, and also 
                                    allowed Kate to spend time with brilliant friends.</p>
                                <p><a href="/">Remembering Not To Forget</a> is the brainchild of Ali and Laura and is 
                                    a testament to their hard work, commitment, craziness and love for their families.</p>

                <h3>More about dementia</h3>

                <p>Memory makes you who you are. Dementia slowly robs you of that. Your personality, the 
                    experiences that have shaped you, that you’ve shared with the people you love, your ability 
                    to carry out everyday tasks like dress, wash and feed yourself, the words you need to communicate 
                    with people. It all slips away.</p>
			   
               <p>There are currently 800,000 people with dementia in the UK, and more than 35 million people 
                    worldwide. This number is expected to almost double every 20 years. Unfortunately this 
                    means that most people will be affected by dementia at some point in their lives, yet it 
                    is a condition that most people know very little about.</p>

                <p>We want to emphasise the five key messages shared by the 
                    <a href="https://www.dementiafriends.org.uk/" target="_blank">Dementia Friends</a> initiative:</p>

                <ul class="rnfflower">
                    <li>
                        <h4>Dementia is not a natural part of aging</h4>
                        <p>Not everyone who grows old will develop dementia, and not everyone who develops dementia 
                            is old.</p>
                        <p>One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, but it also affects 
                            <a href="http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents.php?categoryID=200350"  
                            target="_blank">younger people</a>. 
                            There are currently estimated to be over 40,000 people under 65 living with dementia 
                            in the UK, however the number is likely to be much higher as people often do not seek 
                            a diagnosis at a younger age. People as young as 30 have been diagnosed with dementia.</p>
                        <p>Raising awareness of dementia in younger people is one of our 
                            <a href="/">Remembering Not To Forget</a>’s central aims. You can read more about

                        <h4>Dementia is caused by diseases of the brain</h4>
                        <p>Dementia is the name for a collection of progressive symptoms which include memory loss, 
                            mood changes and problems with communication and reasoning. These symptoms are brought 
                            about by a number of diseases that cause changes in the brain. The most common of these 
                            is Alzheimer's disease (affecting 62% of those living with dementia), which changes the 
                            chemistry and structure of the brain causing the brain cells to die.</p>
                        <p>Other types of dementia include vascular dementia and Pick's disease</p>

                        <h4>Dementia is not just about losing your memory</h4>
                        <p>People often think of dementia as a form of memory loss, and usually it does start by 
                            affecting people's short-term memory. But it's more than that - it can also affect the 
                            way people think, speak, perceive things, feel and behave. Dementia makes it harder to 
                            communicate and do everyday things, but there is a lot that can be done to help. Every 
                            year we understand more about dementia, and develop new strategies that can help to boost 
                            someone's confidence and maintain their independence for as long as possible.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>It’s possible to live well with dementia</h4>
                        <p>Most of us have an image in our mind of what life with dementia looks like. That image is 
                            often very bleak. Dementia does of course bring many challenges, but with the right 
                            knowledge and support it is possible to live well with dementia for a long time.</p>
                        <p>What people can do and how long they can do it for will depend on the circumstances of 
                            each individual. People with dementia can continue to drive, socialise and hold down 
                            satisfying jobs. Even as dementia progresses, many people lead active, healthy lives, 
                            continue their hobbies, and enjoy loving friendships and relationships.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>There’s more to a person than the dementia</h4>
                        <p>Life doesn't end when dementia begins. When someone is diagnosed, their plans for the 
                            future might change and they may need more help and support to keep doing the things 
                            they enjoy. However, just as we would look at someone with cancer or diabetes and see 
                            a person first, there is more to the person than the dementia.</p>

                <p><a href="/">Remembering Not To Forget</a> trustees have been writing about their personal 
                    experiences of dementia in a series of <a href="/blog">blogs</a>.</p>

                <p>Some of us do become more forgetful as we get older or during times of stress or illness, 
                    but dementia is a different sort of forgetfulness. With dementia the memory loss will be 
                    more noticeable, and may be accompanied by mood changes and confusion. If you’re worried 
                    about memory loss it's important to ask your GP to check out any unusual symptoms as these 
                    can sometimes be treated with appropriate medication. Check here for

                <p>Government investment in dementia research has doubled since 2010, and

                    target="_blank">further commitments</a> 
                    were made at the end of 2015. This is fantastic news, however funding for dementia research, 
                    treatment and care is still far below what’s needed.</p>
                <p><a href="/">Remembering Not To Forget</a> is working to raise additional funds and to raise

                                stand down at the next AGM.</li>
                            <li>The trustees may make reasonable additional rules to help run the charity. 
                                These rules must not conflict with this constitution or the law.</li>

                            <li>Money and property must only be used for the charity's purposes.</li>
                            <li>Trustees must keep accounts. The most recent annual accounts can be seen by

                            charity, they must call a General Meeting so that the membership can make the decision. 
                            Trustees must also call a General Meeting if they receive a written request from the 
                            majority of the members. All members must be given 14 days notice and told the reason 
                            for the meeting. All decisions require a two thirds majority. Minutes must be kept.</p>

                            <li>Changes to the Constitution - can be made at AGMs or General Meetings. No change 
                                can be made that would make the organisation no longer a charity.</li>

                        <p>This constitution was adopted on 1st December 2013 by the people whose signatures 
                            appear below (Laura Corrick, Alison Turnbull, Helen Turnbull, Matthew Corrick, 
                            Kathryn Simpson). They are the first members of the charity and will be the trustees 
                            until the AGM, which must be held within one year of this date.</p>
