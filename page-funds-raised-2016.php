            <h2>Distribution of funds raised in 2016</h2>

            <p>At the end of 2016, we had a total of over £10,000 to distribute (we’ll add the final total in early January 2017). This includes funds raised by Remembering Not to Forget trustees and supporters, as well as Gift Aid income.</p>

            <p>We have agreed some of the grants already and details of these are included below. The other grants are still under discussion, information about these will be added once agreed. We aim to distribute 2016 funds by the end of March 2017.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about how funds are being distributed, or would like to do some fundraising for us, please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>

Ultimately, they want to help science beat dementia.</p>

                    <p>Our donation has gone to support the <a href="https://www.alzheimers-brace.org/the-south-west-dementia-brain-bank" target="_blank">South West Dementia Brain Bank</a> based at Southmead Hospital. They urgently need funds for equipment for their laboratories, essential items which are often difficult to fundraise for. Our donation will contribute towards a new freezer, a vital tool for the research. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36918589" target="_blank">Read more about the work of the brain bank</a>.</p>

It is based around the character of Archie the Scarecrow who is living with dementia.</p>

                    <p>Our donation will support work with children in year 4, providing dementia awareness for both the teachers and children, books and workbooks for the children and then facilitating a number of events and ongoing intergenerational activities (e.g. with local care homes). £500 will support the continuation of this project in Wiveliscombe (Helen and Ali’s home town).</p>

                    <p>The other £500 will fund community sessions in Wellington for older people, those living with dementia and their carers and those who may feel lonely and isolated in their community. Sessions include Music and Memories, Themed Reminiscence and Fitness for Fun.</p>
